					<h2>Hi, welcome to my website.</h2> 
					<font size = "+1">
				<p>My name is Khushal and I am a 14 year old school student. Coding is something i love and also learn, my knowledge in the platform include python, html, css and very little java. I'm a huge book lover and have read quite a lot of them, Most of which include fiction novels. Go see my book reviews page for more. I love nature quite a lot the sceneray's of mountains relax my mind by just looking at them. Anime is also something i watch, for more go check out the Anime page in my website. I'm also a collector and collect things from wherever I go, I have a wide range of tickets, bills and coins in my collection  </p>	

				<p>	Most of my achievments revolve around karate and kubudo something that I have been doing for a long time one of the biggest being me getting black 3 in karate. I'd say me building is website is easily one of my biggest achiements I loved this experience learned a lot of new things from my exsisting knowledge as well.  </p>
