			<h1 > 3. Black Clover </h1>

			<font size = "+2" style="color: red;">

				Two orphan boys, Asta and Yuno, are left as babies on a church doorstep on the outer rim of the Clover Kingdom.

			<h1 > 4. Hunter X Hunter </h1>

			<font size = "+2" style="color: red;">

				I haven't finished with this series yet but I am only halfway done and this is easily one of the best anime's out there.
		<br>	The story starts with Gon, a 12-year-old boy who sets out for a journey to find his father and his first step is to become a  
		<br>	Hunter. A Hunter is an individual who has enough luck and talent to pass the Hunter exam. A Hunter specializes in 
		<br>	something, can be practically anything, you name it. A Hunter lives by a power system called Nen in a universe that 
		<br>	cleverly reflects the dark side of our real world. Essentially, being a Hunter isn't special but when it's combined 
		<br>	with a well-designed power system and universe, it means infinite possibilities. All in all, Hunter x Hunter (2011)
		<br> 	exceeds all my expectations. I would recommend this series to anyone, well-executed and very enjoyable.

			<h1 > 5. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood </h1>

			<font size = "+2" style="color: red;">

					After a horrific alchemy experiment goes wrong in the Elric household. Ignoring the alchemical principle banning human 
			<br>	transmutation, the boys attempted to bring their recently deceased mother back to life. Instead, they suffered
			<br>	 brutal personal loss: Alphonse's body disintegrated while Edward lost a leg and then sacrificed an arm to keep Alphonse's soul
			<br>	in the physical realm by binding it to a hulking suit of armor. The brothers are rescued by their neighbor Pinako Rockbell
			<br>	their neighbor Pinako Rockbell and her granddaughter Winry. Known as a bio-mechanical engineering prodigy, Winry  
			<br>	creates prosthetic	limbs for Edward by utilizing "automail," a tough, versatile metal used in robots and combat armor. 
			<br>	After years of training, the Elric brothers set off on a quest to restore their bodies by locating the Philosopher's Stone—a powerful 
			<br>	gem that allows an alchemist to defy the traditional laws of Equivalent Exchange. As Edward becomes an infamous alchemist
			<br>	 and gains the nickname "Fullmetal," the boys' journey embroils them in a growing conspiracy that threatens the fate of the world.
			<br>    The anime story was excellent and the fights are great.

			<h1 > 6. Seven Deadly Sins </h1>

			<font size = "+2" style="color: red;">

				This was a great Anime with great story but it had one major flaw "too many overpowered  
		<br>	apart from that everything else was great.The Seven Deadly Sins were once a group of knights in the region of 
		<br>	Britannia, who disbanded after they supposedly plotted to overthrow the Liones Kingdom. Their supposed defeat came at 
		<br>	the hands of the Holy Knights, but rumors continued to persist that they were still alive. Ten years later, the Holy 
		<br>	Knights staged a coup d'etat and captured the king, becoming the new, tyrannical rulers of the kingdom. The third princess, 
		<br>	Elizabeth, then starts out on a journey to find the Seven Deadly Sins and enlist their help in taking back the kingdom.
		<br>	Not long before it turns out the holy knight grandmaster was trying to ressurect the ten commandments(a great evil that
		<br>	was sealed by the goddess race 3000 years ago).
