		<h2>Summoner series:</h2>
		
		
		<font size = "+1" >
		<b>	It is an amazing series one of the best that I have ever read i would reccomend this to anyone. It is a three book series. The story starts like this Working in the market selling weapons with his adoptive father one day, 15-year-old Fletcher is intrigued by a seller across the way a veteran of the orc wars come to town selling different kinds of old soldier equipment. He spins a yarn for each object in front of a crowd and leaves a book for last, one he claims was written by a battlemage with instructions for summoning a demon. Only nobility and a few commoners can even summon demons, so Fletcher is not tempted to buy. But after befriending the veteran over drinks, the book ends up in his hands anyway. Fletcher takes the book to the graveyard, not realizing he's been followed, just to try the summoning spell. After a demon appears, so does trouble. A boy named Didric and his hired goons go after Fletcher, threatening his life, and Fletcher finds out just how tough his demon is. Fletcher runs away from an unconscious, burned, and possibly dead Didric and skips town, taking his demon with him. In the big city of Corcillum more trouble finds him, but so does a man named Arcturus, one of the teachers at Vocans Academy, a school that trains those who can summon demons to be battlemages. With that, Fletcher enters the academy and discovers a world far outside his small town one where dwarves, elves, and humans old enemies need to work and train together, or the growing power of the orcs will defeat them all.</b>

	  <h2> Da vinci code </h2>	
	  <font size = "+1" >
  <b> When i first read Harry potter, I though no book could ever rival it but after I read this one all my perceptions changed. While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever. </b>
